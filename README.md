This is Practise python file with the Help of MachineHack website to perform some Models based on the Problem Statement.

Challenge Link- https://machinehack.com/hackathons/biohack_predicting_protein_mass

I performed some basic EDA practises as the data was already neat and clean as the main objective was to practise on building models for this Regression problem.

I have made around 11 models revolving around the problem statement and the main criteria to check the model performance was RMSE Score.

In order to simplify the calculations and to increase the efficiency , I have created a function which takes values and gives us the required answers.

Before the final submission, the xtest was not scaled, so it was scaled and then passed on for prediction.

The RMSE Values has to be kept minimum and out of all 11 models, Fined Tuned RandomForest Regressor  gave me the lowest RMSE values for the Test score.

Sharing the Jupyter file along with the files that were required in this analysis.

Thank You.
Zaid.
